Brandel, Carson P. McCann, Dr. Jay J. Doucet, Dr. Todd W. Costantini, Dr. Alexander A. Khalessi, and Dr. Joseph D. Ciacci for JAMA Surgery on April 10 2024.
            <br>
            <b>Abstract:</b> There has been growing interest in the implications of the recent US-Mexico border wall extension for migrant health and local health care systems. Previous studies have associated this 30-ft height extension with increased mortality and incidence of traumatic brain, spine, and cerebrovascular injuries. Another previous study compared border fall to general population injuries but predated the height extension.4 We aimed to characterize traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) and overall care associated with falls at the San Diego, California, border compared with general population falls, to guide future health care and border policies.

        Borders, nation-states, and the regimes that maintain them haven't always looked the way they do today. These texts introduce the reader to how the "Western world" conceptualized of and built these modern systems and ideas.

        <h3>"Geographies of Migration and Mobility" taught by <a target="_blank" href="https://austinkocher.com/">Austin Kocher</a> at Syracuse University</h3>

        <blockquote>
            Although human beings have always moved around the planet, migration has become a defining characteristic of the contemporary world with 281 million people—or 3.6% of Earth’s total population—now living outside the country of their birth. At the same time, growth in global migration has been accompanied by the unprecedented growth of new geographies of migration controls including border walls, immigration policing in everyday spaces, a global network of immigrant detention centers, and new restrictive immigration policies worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic has also prompted controversial new immigration restrictions. This course provides an in-depth examination of the relationship between global migration and migration controls through a critical geographic lens by examining the emergent spaces, places, and networks that make these controls possible.
        </blockquote>

        <h3>"Critical Geographies of Climate Migration" taught by <a target="_blank" href="https://austinkocher.com/">Austin Kocher</a> at George Washington University</h3>

        <blockquote>
            Earth’s changing climate is dramatically rearranging the geographies of where people live. Each year, the consequences of climate change lead more people to relocate within their country, such as Californians leaving the state due to wildfires, or migrate beyond their borders, such as residents in North Africa facing extreme water scarcity. Yet too often, the relationship between climate change and human migration are assumed rather than interrogated. Critical Geographies of Climate Migration provides a graduate level introduction to the complex relationships between human migration and climate change, not as isolated phenomena, but as inter-related consequences of the geographic organization of society due to capitalism, nation-states and borders, colonialism, political conflict, and resource extraction. Although this course incorporates the latest research on climate science, the course investigates climate migration primarily through a critical geography lens that emphasizes questions of power, space, identity, and the conditions of possibility for meaningful change. Rather than starting from the assumption that a unique phenomenon called climate migration exists, the course scrutinizes this increasingly hegemonic framework both in terms of its empirical and analytical contributions as well as its limitations, contradiction, and absences. Course readings will draw eclectically from geographic scholarship, including recent work on the international migration and refugee system, climate nationalism, and the anthropocene; case studies across the Global North and South; recent government- and NGO-sponsored analyses of climate migration; and first-hand accounts of living in the most ecologically vulnerable parts of the planet.

        Series Description
        </summary>
        While scouring the Sonoran Desert for objects left behind by migrants crossing into the United States, anthropologist Jason De León happened upon something he didn't expect to get left behind: a human arm, stripped of flesh. <br><br>
        
        This macabre discovery sent him reeling, needing to know what exactly happened to the body, and how many migrants die that way in the wilderness. In researching border-crosser deaths in the Arizona desert, he noticed something surprising. Sometime in the late-1990s, the number of migrant deaths shot up dramatically and have stayed high since. Jason traced this increase to a Border Patrol policy still in effect, called “Prevention Through Deterrence.” <br><br>
        
        In a series first aired back in 2018, over three episodes, Radiolab investigates this policy, its surprising origins, and the people whose lives were changed forever because of it.

        Episode Description
        </summary>
        We begin one afternoon in May 1992, when a student named Albert stumbled in late for history class at Bowie High School in El Paso, Texas. His excuse: Border Patrol. Soon more stories of students getting stopped and harassed by Border Patrol started pouring in. So begins the unlikely story of how a handful of Mexican-American high schoolers in one of the poorest neighborhoods in the country stood up to what is today the country’s largest federal law enforcement agency. They had no way of knowing at the time, but what would follow was a chain of events that would drastically change the US-Mexico border.

        <summary>
        Episode Description
        </summary>
        After the showdown in court with Bowie High School, Border Patrol brings in a fresh face to head its dysfunctional El Paso Sector: Silvestre Reyes. The first Mexican-American to ever hold the position, Reyes knows something needs to change and has an idea how to do it. One Saturday night at midnight, with the element of surprise on his side, Reyes unveils ... Operation Blockade. It wins widespread support for the Border Patrol in El Paso, but sparks major protests across the Rio Grande. Soon after, he gets a phone call that catapults his little experiment onto the national stage, where it works so well that it diverts migrant crossing patterns along the entire U.S.-Mexico Border. <br><br>
        
        Years later, in the Arizona desert, anthropologist Jason de León realizes that in order to accurately gauge how many migrants die crossing the desert, he must first understand how human bodies decompose in such an extreme environment. He sets up a macabre experiment, and what he finds is more drastic than anything he could have expected.

        Episode Description
        </summary>
        The third episode in our Border Trilogy follows anthropologist Jason De León after he makes a grisly discovery in Arivaca, Arizona. In the middle of carrying out his pig experiments with his students, Jason finds the body of a 30-year-old female migrant. With the help of the medical examiner and some local humanitarian groups, Jason discovers her identity. Her name was Maricela. Jason then connects with her family, including her brother-in-law, who survived his own harrowing journey through Central America and the Arizona desert. <br><br>
        
        With the human cost of Prevention Through Deterrence weighing on our minds, we try to parse what drives migrants like Maricela to cross through such deadly terrain, and what, if anything, could deter them.
