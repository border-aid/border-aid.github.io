    <h2>Who Makes This Site? Why?</h2>

    <p>
        This website is created and maintained by volunteers in the border aid community. We made this website to collect information and tools relevant to our mission; as an informal network of individuals and organizations, formal and informal, we did not previously have a common collection of these things to share with friends, family, migrants, and new volunteers.
        <br><br>
        As this website is maintained by volunteers, it is updated with a frequency varying between every few days to every 1-2 weeks.
        <br><br>
        For a more thorough introduction to the border aid community, please refer to the <a target="_self" href="what-is-happening.html">What's Happening?</a> page
