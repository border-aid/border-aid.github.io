     Summary
    </h2>
    <p>
     Since September 7 2023, US Customs &amp; Border Patrol agents have been detaining migrants in open-air detention sites without food, water, shelter, medical care, or sanitation. Hundreds of people, including tiny babies, pregnant women, folks with injuries - everybody. People regularly die in these deserts, from thirst, injury, heatstroke, and hypothermia. Two Guinean migrants have died at one of the San Ysidro sites that Border Patrol restricts us from accessing under threat of arrest - without volunteers, there was no one there to call an ambulance. Even after these refugees have been processed, Border Patrol dumps them at random transit stations, with no clue of how to get to their sponsors, which city they're in, or where to sleep - in a city that criminalizes homelessness. This isn't the first time CBP has operated open-air detention sites of this nature; CBP agents operated OADS in May 2023 in response to the end of Title 42.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <a href="#participating-orgs" target="_self">
      Local mutual aid organizations
     </a>
     have stepped up to provide basic necessities to these trapped migrants. We prepare meals and water for hundreds of migrants every day; we collect and distribute blankets, jackets, shoes, and other clothing; we administer first aid and coordinate EMS for migrants' medical emergencies; we build shelters and set up tents and tarps to protect migrants from the elements; we reunite separated families (and even form emergency search parties to locate migrants lost in the wilderness); we open our homes to migrants who have nowhere else to go in the days before their flights to their loved ones. Most of us have day jobs and burn through our own tanks of $6/gallon California gas to drive down to San Ysidro or an hour east to Jacumba. This care should not be the responsibility of local volunteers funded with donations and sparse disposable income. We choose to support the people that CBP abandons because we care about the survival of our fellow human beings, but we are angry at the US politicians, law enforcement officers, and bureaucrats who refuse to take responsibility for the people they are detaining. CBP, a government agency whose budget includes
     <a href="https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/FY23%20BILL%20HIGHLIGHTS_DHS1.pdf" target="_blank">
      $16.464 billion in base discretionary funding, "as well as $1.563 billion to address increased encounters at the Southwest Border"
     </a>
     , should not be leaving local Good Samaritans to care for the people they detain. We are broke and exhausted - we have been running multiple support operations across the county for more than 12 hours of the day, every day, for months, with no end in sight, while local conservative news stations encourage their viewers to show up to our mutual aid stations to harrass us, and while CBP agents destroy shelters and trash blankets.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Make no mistake - we try every day to get government officials to listen to us. On September 26 2023 - 19 days into this crisis - and in response to extended pressure from the border aid community, San Diego County's board of supervisors finally declared a humanitarian crisis.
On October 11 2023 - 15 days later, 34 days into the crisis - supervisors allocated a grant of $3 million to South Bay Community Services for support of migrants being dropped off by CBP at transit stations. Though we volunteers were encouraged by this show of material support from the board, this grant still left support of migrants in open-air detention sites completely up to volunteers, and, as we would learn throughout the grant's lifetime, SBCS would seriously mismanage the funds, still leaving a lot of post-CBP-processing support work to volunteers. We submitted a
     <a href="#concerns-about-sbcs" target="_self">
      letter detailing our concerns about SBCS' mismanagement
     </a>
     to the board of supervisors, urging them to allocate the funds to the
     <a href="#participating-orgs" target="_self">
      organizations already doing vital border aid work
     </a>
     ; sadly our concerns were ignored, and on December 5 2023 SBCS received a second $3 million grant. As of February 23 2024, SBCS has exhausted both grants, worth a total of 6 million dollars, and is no longer providing street release support to migrants.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     We desperately need help. We need donations, more volunteers, people to harangue government officials into doing *anything*. Even $5 helps - we're shopping at dollar stores and discount stores to make every cent stretch as far as possible through this state-manufactured humanitarian crisis. Please visit the

    <p>
     Unfortunately, San Diego is not the only community struggling to support people in CBP's open-air detention sites. Below is a list of "sister organizations" that we know of - compas who are doing the same work we do, in other borderlands. The fight to save migrants from violence enacted in service of borders is global - our community is a single star in a constellation of humanitarian struggles.

         I spoke briefly with some men from Brazil who, through a language barrier, tried to ask me how much longer they would have to be there. One of them tried to convey how cold nights could get by clutching his shoulders and saying ice, repeatedly, followed by “night” and “noche.”

         When I arrived, agents were in the process of transporting some asylum seekers to be processed. Such facilities are referred to as “the Ice Box,” or “the Fridge.” This alludes to the austere interior, and the frigid air.

         Troublingly, I’ve received multiple reports of Border Patrol dropping migrants at transit hubs throughout the county. Service providers are overwhelmed, and likely being provided insufficient notice.

         </summary>
         Al Otro Lado's executive director discusses what’s to come this election year: more of the CBP One app and open-air border prisons, along with a hyper-distorted fearmongering narrative of overwhelm.

        <br/>
        This article and its headline obfuscate the details of how, exactly, the aid money ran out. The facts of the matter:
        <ul>
         <li>
          The San Diego County Board of Supervisors (SD BOS) awarded South Bay Community Services (SBCS) a 3 million dollar grant on October 11 2023, to operate a "street release support" center. This center's role was to receive migrants being released from detention centers after CBP processed them, and then help migrants make plans to travel to their asylum sponsor.
         </li>
         <li>
          SBCS had not been involved in border aid prior to being awarded this grant.
         </li>
         <li>
          Members of the border aid community observed or received reports from migrants on questionable practices by SBCS in operating this "welcome center".
         </li>
         <li>
          The SD BOS considers awarding SBCS a second 3 million dollar grant.
         </li>
         <li>
          On December 4 2023, the border aid community sends
          <a href="./media/2023-12-04 Humanitarian Response Partners Letter to Board of Supervisors.pdf" target="_blank">
           the letter "Re: Request for transparency, accountability and a new direction in welcoming asylum seeking migrants with dignity and respect"
          </a>
          to the SD BOS, registering our concerns about the possibility of SBCS receiving a second 3 million dollar grant.
         </li>
         <li>
          Members of the border aid community registered their opposition to SBCS receiving the second 3 million dollar grant on the grounds cited in the Decmber 4 letter, as can be seen in the SD BOS' records of

          by members of the public.

         <li>
          The SD BOS approved the second 3 million dollar grant at the
          <a href="https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/sdc/cob/bosa/bos-calendar-meetings.html?date=12/05/2023&amp;meetingtype=BOARD%20OF%20SUPERVISORS" target="_blank">

          </a>
         </li>
         <li>
          On February 22 2024, SBCS ended its welcome center services. They refuse to work with fellow San Diego nonprofits to provide greater transparency on how the funds were used and how they tracked total migrants served.
         </li>
         <li>
          On February 23 2024, border aid community members resumed street release support without SBCS' participation.

         "Migrants campout waiting to be processed near US-Mexico border as Congress considers military aid package" by Ciara Encinas for ABC 10 News San Diego on December 12 2023

        <br/>
        This article has had 2 title variations - the original began "Migrants continue to camp near border", while the current reads "Migrants campout waiting to be processed". Both versions are somewhat misleading, obfuscating the fact that these are open air detention sites where CBP is detaining migrants -
        <i>
         not
        </i>
        just "camps", that migrants could leave at any time. The fact of CBP's active custody of these migrants carries a legal responsibility for CBP to provide necessities like food, water, shelter, medical care, and sanitation. Obfuscating the fact that these migrants are in CBP custody lends credence to CBP's false claim to the contrary, and is thus an irresponsible editorial choice.

         "A crisis at the Mexico border felt in Ukraine" by Sarah Smith for BBC on December 8 2023
        </summary>
        <b>
         Community Corrections
        </b>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The first person we hear from in this article is a disgruntled landowner - who has previously fired a warning shot in a disagreement with migrants, as reported by Melissa Gomez for the LA Times - chiding migrants for not “[doing] what he did and [finding] a legal route into the US”. Smith does not mention this person’s previous behavior, and does not contextualize his chiding about “legal routes” into the US with any detail about immigration policy or changes therein within the past few decades.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The author includes a short digression about the experience of a single migrant in a single camp almost as an afterthought to a breathless discussion of US government officials using immigrants as bargaining chips in legislative negotiations. The article does not challenge the pitting of one desperate group - Ukrainians fighting invasion - against another - migrants fleeing poverty and violence.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Overall, Sarah Smith’s presentation of the situation is as sloppy as her spellchecking of the name “Jacumaba”. Members of the border aid volunteer community are frustrated by Smith’s centering of landowner complaints and politicians’ cynical grandstanding over the pain, fear, and confusion that migrants face at the whim of CBP officers. Smith’s article would benefit greatly from at least featuring a longer quote from a migrant in fear of reprisal from the Taliban than from Senator Lindsey Graham.
