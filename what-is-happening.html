<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
Since September 7 2023, Border Patrol has been locking refugees in the space between the border walls and leaving them in the desert, then claiming that these folks are not being detained, so they have a justification for abandoning these people without food, water, shelter, medical care, or sanitation. Hundreds of people, including tiny babies, pregnant women, folks with injuries - everybody. People regularly die in these deserts, from thirst, injury, heatstroke, and hypothermia. Two Guinean migrants have died at one of the San Ysidro sites that Border Patrol restricts us from accessing under threat of arrest - without volunteers, there was no one there to call an ambulance. Even after these refugees have been processed, Border Patrol dumps them at random transit stations, with no clue of how to get to their sponsors, where to sleep - in a city that criminalizes homelessness - or sometimes which city they're in.
<br><br>
Local mutual aid organizations have stepped up to provide basic necessities to these trapped migrants. Most of us have day jobs and burn through our own tanks of $6/gallon California gas to drive down to San Ysidro or an hour east to Jacumba. We are funded solely through donations and our own spare cash - which is sparse, in a county as expensive as San Diego. Most of all, our volunteers are so, so tired - we have been running multiple support operations across the county for more than 12 hours of the day, every day, for the past 2.5 months, with no end in sight. It does not matter that this a Democratic state, city, presidency - all of them are doing NOTHING. Instead of helping, our city government has instead been busy filing amicus briefs pushing the Supreme Court to allow city officials to prosecute homeless people even further. All of this while our local conservative news station encourages its viewers to show up to our mutual aid stations and harrass us.
<br><br>
We desperately need help. We need donations, more volunteers, people to harangue government officials into doing *anything*. Even $5 helps - we're shopping at dollar stores and discount stores to make every cent stretch as far as possible through this state-manufactured humanitarian crisis.

Series Description
</summary>
While scouring the Sonoran Desert for objects left behind by migrants crossing into the United States, anthropologist Jason De León happened upon something he didn't expect to get left behind: a human arm, stripped of flesh. <br><br>

This macabre discovery sent him reeling, needing to know what exactly happened to the body, and how many migrants die that way in the wilderness. In researching border-crosser deaths in the Arizona desert, he noticed something surprising. Sometime in the late-1990s, the number of migrant deaths shot up dramatically and have stayed high since. Jason traced this increase to a Border Patrol policy still in effect, called “Prevention Through Deterrence.” <br><br>

In a series first aired back in 2018, over three episodes, Radiolab investigates this policy, its surprising origins, and the people whose lives were changed forever because of it.

<h5>Border Trilogy Part 1: Hole in the Fence</h5>

October 13 2023 <br><br>

<details>
<summary>
Episode Description
</summary>
We begin one afternoon in May 1992, when a student named Albert stumbled in late for history class at Bowie High School in El Paso, Texas. His excuse: Border Patrol. Soon more stories of students getting stopped and harassed by Border Patrol started pouring in. So begins the unlikely story of how a handful of Mexican-American high schoolers in one of the poorest neighborhoods in the country stood up to what is today the country’s largest federal law enforcement agency. They had no way of knowing at the time, but what would follow was a chain of events that would drastically change the US-Mexico border.

<h5>Border Trilogy Part 2: Hold the Line</h5>

<summary>
Episode Description
</summary>
After the showdown in court with Bowie High School, Border Patrol brings in a fresh face to head its dysfunctional El Paso Sector: Silvestre Reyes. The first Mexican-American to ever hold the position, Reyes knows something needs to change and has an idea how to do it. One Saturday night at midnight, with the element of surprise on his side, Reyes unveils ... Operation Blockade. It wins widespread support for the Border Patrol in El Paso, but sparks major protests across the Rio Grande. Soon after, he gets a phone call that catapults his little experiment onto the national stage, where it works so well that it diverts migrant crossing patterns along the entire U.S.-Mexico Border. <br><br>

Years later, in the Arizona desert, anthropologist Jason de León realizes that in order to accurately gauge how many migrants die crossing the desert, he must first understand how human bodies decompose in such an extreme environment. He sets up a macabre experiment, and what he finds is more drastic than anything he could have expected.

Episode Description
</summary>
The third episode in our Border Trilogy follows anthropologist Jason De León after he makes a grisly discovery in Arivaca, Arizona. In the middle of carrying out his pig experiments with his students, Jason finds the body of a 30-year-old female migrant. With the help of the medical examiner and some local humanitarian groups, Jason discovers her identity. Her name was Maricela. Jason then connects with her family, including her brother-in-law, who survived his own harrowing journey through Central America and the Arizona desert. <br><br>

With the human cost of Prevention Through Deterrence weighing on our minds, we try to parse what drives migrants like Maricela to cross through such deadly terrain, and what, if anything, could deter them.

"Migrants campout waiting to be processed near US-Mexico border as Congress considers military aid package" by Ciara Encinas for ABC 10 News San Diego on December 12 2023
</summary>

<b>Community Corrections</b>
<br><br>

This article has had 2 title variations - the original began "Migrants continue to camp near border", while the current reads "Migrants campout waiting to be processed". Both versions are somewhat misleading, obfuscating the fact that these are open air detention sites where CBP is detaining migrants - <i>not</i> just "camps", that migrants could leave at any time. The fact of CBP's active custody of these migrants carries a legal responsibility for CBP to provide necessities like food, water, shelter, medical care, and sanitation. Obfuscating the fact that these migrants are in CBP custody lends credence to CBP's false claim to the contrary, and is thus an irresponsible editorial choice.

"A crisis at the Mexico border felt in Ukraine" by Sarah Smith for BBC on December 8 2023
</summary>
<b>Community Corrections</b>
<br><br>
The first person we hear from in this article is a disgruntled landowner - who has previously fired a warning shot in a disagreement with migrants, as reported by Melissa Gomez for the LA Times - chiding migrants for not “[doing] what he did and [finding] a legal route into the US”. Smith does not mention this person’s previous behavior, and does not contextualize his chiding about “legal routes” into the US with any detail about immigration policy or changes therein within the past few decades. 
<br><br>
The author includes a short digression about the experience of a single migrant in a single camp almost as an afterthought to a breathless discussion of US government officials using immigrants as bargaining chips in legislative negotiations. The article does not challenge the pitting of one desperate group - Ukrainians fighting invasion - against another - migrants fleeing poverty and violence.
<br><br>
Overall, Sarah Smith’s presentation of the situation is as sloppy as her spellchecking of the name “Jacumaba”. Members of the border aid volunteer community are frustrated by Smith’s centering of landowner complaints and politicians’ cynical grandstanding over the pain, fear, and confusion that migrants face at the whim of CBP officers. Smith’s article would benefit greatly from at least featuring a longer quote from a migrant in fear of reprisal from the Taliban than from Senator Lindsey Graham.
