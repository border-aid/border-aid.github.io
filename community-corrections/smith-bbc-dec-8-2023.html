The first person we hear from in this article is a disgruntled landowner - who has previously fired a warning shot in a disagreement with migrants, as reported by Melissa Gomez for the LA Times - chiding migrants for not “[doing] what he did and [finding] a legal route into the US”. Smith does not mention this person’s previous behavior, and does not contextualize his chiding about “legal routes” into the US with any detail about immigration policy or changes therein within the past few decades.

The author includes a short digression about the experience of a single migrant in a single camp almost as an afterthought to a breathless discussion of US government officials using immigrants as bargaining chips in legislative negotiations. The article does not challenge the pitting of one desperate group - Ukrainians fighting invasion - against another - migrants fleeing poverty and violence.

Overall, Sarah Smith’s presentation of the situation is as sloppy as her spellchecking of the name “Jacumaba”. Members of the border aid volunteer community are frustrated by Smith’s centering of landowner complaints and politicians’ cynical grandstanding over the pain, fear, and confusion that migrants face at the whim of CBP officers. Smith’s article would benefit greatly from at least featuring a longer quote from a migrant in fear of reprisal from the Taliban than from Senator Lindsey Graham.
