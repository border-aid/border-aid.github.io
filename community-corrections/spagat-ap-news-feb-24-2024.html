This article and its headline obfuscate the details of how, exactly, the aid money ran out. The facts of the matter:

<ul>

  <li>
    The San Diego County Board of Supervisors (SD BOS) awarded South Bay Community Services (SBCS) a 3 million dollar grant on October 11 2023, to operate a "street release support" center. This center's role was to receive migrants being released from detention centers after CBP processed them, and then help migrants make plans to travel to their asylum sponsor.
  </li>

  <li>
    SBCS had not been involved in border aid prior to being awarded this grant.
  </li>

  <li>
    Members of the border aid community observed or received reports from migrants on questionable practices by SBCS in operating this "welcome center".
  </li>

  <li>
    The SD BOS considers awarding SBCS a second 3 million dollar grant. 
    </li>
    
  <li>
    On December 4 2023, the border aid community sends <a target="_blank" href="./media/2023-12-04 Humanitarian Response Partners Letter to Board of Supervisors.pdf">the letter "Re: Request for transparency, accountability and a new direction in welcoming asylum seeking migrants with dignity and respect"</a> to the SD BOS, registering our concerns about the possibility of SBCS receiving a second 3 million dollar grant.
  </li>

  <li>
    Members of the border aid community registered their opposition to SBCS receiving the second 3 million dollar grant on the grounds cited in the Decmber 4 letter, as can be seen in the SD BOS' records of <a target="_blank" href="https://bosagenda.sandiegocounty.gov/cobservice/cosd/cob/content?id=0901127e81051bd2">in-person comment</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://bosagenda.sandiegocounty.gov/cobservice/cosd/cob/content?id=0901127e81051bd0">eComment</a> by members of the public.
  </li>

  <li>
    The SD BOS approved the second 3 million dollar grant at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/sdc/cob/bosa/bos-calendar-meetings.html?date=12/05/2023&meetingtype=BOARD%20OF%20SUPERVISORS">December 5 2023 regular meeting</a>
  </li>

  <li>
    On February 22 2024, SBCS ended its welcome center services. They refuse to work with fellow San Diego nonprofits to provide greater transparency on how the funds were used and how they tracked total migrants served.
  </li>

  <li>
    On February 23 2024, border aid community members resumed street release support without SBCS' participation.
