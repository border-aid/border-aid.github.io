This article has had 2 title variations - the original began "Migrants continue to camp near border", while the current reads "Migrants campout waiting to be processed". Both versions are somewhat misleading, obfuscating the fact that these are open air detention sites where CBP is detaining migrants - <i>not</i> just "camps", that migrants could leave at any time. The fact of CBP's active custody of these migrants carries a legal responsibility for CBP to provide necessities like food, water, shelter, medical care, and sanitation. Obfuscating the fact that these migrants are in CBP custody lends credence to CBP's false claim to the contrary, and is thus an irresponsible editorial choice.
