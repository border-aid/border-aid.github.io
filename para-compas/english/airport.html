     </a>
    </li>
    <li>
     Terminal 1 has one floor
    </li>
    <li>
     Terminal 2 has two floors
     <ul>
      <li>
       The first floor is baggage claim/arrivals.
      </li>
      <li>
       The second floor is TSA/Security and departures. It is separated into two sections and to get from one section to the other, you must either
       <ul>
        <li>
         go downstairs
        </li>
        <li>
         walk outside on the second floor
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     We recommend entering the airport through Terminal 2.
     <br/>
     If you are facing the airport:
     <ul>
      <li>
       Go to the left to get to: United, JetBlue, Delta
      </li>
      <li>
       Go to the right to get to: Alaska, American
      </li>
      <li>
       Go downstairs and walk to the right (about 10 minutes) to get to: terminal 1 (Frontier, Spirit, Southwest)
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     It is better to buy a plane ticket online. Only some airlines will let you buy a ticket at the counter, and there is usually a fee. The ticket counters do not accept cash.
    </li>
    <li>
     The airport wifi is stronger in terminal 2, near the escalator. Go there for better internet connection when booking flight tickets.
