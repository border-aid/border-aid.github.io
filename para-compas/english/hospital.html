This page is for those who were directly sent to a hospital before being processed by immigration agents in a Border Patrol facility. <br><br>

<b>If you are having a medical emergency, there may not be time to collect all the information we need to follow up with you</b>, but we will try our best to ensure that there is a safe plan in place for when you are ready to be discharged from the hospital.<br><br>
    
Please note that the information we have gathered below is from a combination of direct experience and conversations with friends who are legal service providers. <b>That being said, Customs and Border Protection frequently flouts their own protocols and policies, so we welcome feedback on how to make this page and website more useful to you all.</b> <br><br>
    
<b>We do NOT share ANY of this information with Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or the Department of Homeland Security.</b> The information we collect is solely meant to help us support you as best we can and to make sure we are providing appropriate guidance. We will not use the information in any other capacity without your consent. <br><br>
    
<h3>Before the Hospital</h3>
<ul>
<li>Please talk to the volunteers on-site if you are concerned about your health, have any symptoms you want to discuss, and/or want to go to the hospital. </li>

<li> <b> To the extent that we can control, no decisions will be made without your explicit consent. </b> </li>

<li>If you want to go to the hospital, a volunteer will either call Customs and Border Patrol (who should then call for an ambulance via 911) or will call 911 directly depending on the urgency of the situation. </li>

<li>
<b>We ask for name, phone number, preferred language, and the best way to contact you (e.g. WhatsApp)</b> so that we can ensure you have a safe place to go once you are ready to leave the hospital. 
<ul>
    <li> <b>
        If you do not want to share your contact information with us, you can call the Google Voice number ( <a href="tel:+1-619-800-2083">+1 (619) 800-2083</a> ) to ask for guidance on how to access resources and support to get to your final destination, pick up medications, find a doctor wherever you end up, as well as apply for asylum. Your hospital care team can also help you call if needed.  
    </b> </li>
</ul>
</li>
    
<li>If you are traveling with anyone over the age of 18, Customs and Border Patrol will likely separate you. If you are traveling with children under the age of 18, they should be allowed to accompany you. If your child is the one who needs medical attention, you should be allowed to accompany them. </li>

<li>Please make sure to take all of your belongings, especially your IDs and other important documents. </li>

<li>The ambulance will take you to a hospital.</li>

</ul>
    
<h3>At the Hospital</h3>
The hospital cannot force you to do anything, except under very specific circumstances. At a minimum, your hospital care team should explain to you what they want to do, why, and the risks and benefits. They should also be ready to provide alternatives as well as answer any questions you may have. The decision about what happens, ultimately, is yours to make. 
    
<ul>

<li>You will be brought to the emergency room of a hospital where they will ask you why you came/what is going on, give you some paperwork to fill out (try to be as accurate as possible but you do not need to disclose anything you do not want to), and check your vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate, oxygen saturation).</li>

<li>You will be asked to wait in the waiting room until someone calls you back, which can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 4+ hours.</li> 

<li>A team of health care workers will evaluate you and determine whether they think you should 1) be admitted to the hospital to continue treatment and monitoring or 2) be discharged from the emergency room.</li>

<li><b>By law, hospitals are required to provide interpretation services.</b> You can and should ask that members of the team use an interpreter to speak with you if English is not a language you feel comfortable using in this context.</li>

<li>If you shared your contact information with us, a volunteer with the same group of people helping out in San Ysidro and/or Jacumba will message you to help you figure out where to go and how as well as what your options for asylum are once you are ready to leave the hospital. </li>

<li>Sometimes the emergency room team will recommend that you pick up prescription medications or other supplies - if you would like assistance getting those, please let the volunteer who has connected with you know.</li>

</ul>

<h3>After the Hospital</h3>
The volunteer who has connected with you will try to help you get where you need to go next, which depends on a few factors:

<ul>

<li>Where are you trying to go? Do you need to fly? Or can you get there by bus, train, car? </li>

<li>Do you have a sponsor there?</li>

<li>Do you have a hard copy of your passport? Do you have any other form of ID? </li>

<li>Do you have money right now to purchase a plane ticket, or can someone else purchase the ticket for you?</li>

<li>Do you need a place to spend the night? </li>

</ul>

<b>If you have a valid physical passport, you may proceed to your final destination within the United States, and then submit immigration paperwork from there. You cannot do this with just a copy or photo of a passport. </b> <br><br>

<b>If you are sent directly to the hospital before being processed by Border Patrol, then you will NOT have the same paperwork as the people with whom you were traveling. </b> <br><br>

Hospitals have been sending migrants to the ICE office on Front St. after they are discharged to try to get that paperwork. <b>Based on reports from allied attorneys, we do NOT recommend you do that without first discussing your options with one of our volunteers.</b> We have seen folks do that and end up getting put in ICE detention in Otay Mesa. <br><br>

<b>HOWEVER, you can still apply for asylum.</b> Once you get where you want to go, you need to find an attorney who can help you apply for asylum through the Asylum Office. You must submit that application within 1 year or 365 days of “entering” the “U.S.” <br><br>

You can use the following nonprofit legal service networks to search for an attorney who may be able to help you:

<ul>
    <li> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.immigrationadvocates.org/nonprofit/legaldirectory/">Immigration Advocates Network</a> </li>
    <li> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_interest/immigration/projects_initiatives/immigration-justice-project/contact-us/">American Bar Association Immigration Justice Project</a> or call <a href="tel:+1-619-255-8810">+1 (619) 255-8810</a> </li>
</ul>

Our volunteers can share with you a list of legal service providers based near wherever you end up. They can also help you find a low-cost/sliding scale/free clinic to follow up on whatever sent you to the hospital as well as your chronic health conditions. <br>
