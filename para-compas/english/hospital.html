    <h2>Hospital Information</h2>
    <p><strong>There is a group of volunteers that have access to constantly changing resources that are not named in this flyer. Call or text <a href="tel:+1-619-800-2083">+1 (619) 800-2083</a> (NOT available with WhatsApp) for assistance.</strong></p>
    
    <h3>If you go to the hospital in an ambulance</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Please make sure to take all of your belongings, especially your IDs and other important documents.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you are traveling with anyone over the age of 18, Customs and Border Patrol will likely separate you. If you are traveling with children under the age of 18, they should be allowed to accompany you. If your child is the one who needs medical attention, you should be allowed to accompany them. If you get separated make sure you have a way to contact your family after you are released from the hospital.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>At the Hospital</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The hospital cannot force you to do anything, except under very specific circumstances. At a minimum, your hospital care team should explain to you what they want to do, why, and the risks and benefits. They should also be ready to provide alternatives as well as answer any questions you may have. The decision about what happens, ultimately, is yours to make.
        </li>
        <li>
            You will be brought to the emergency room of a hospital where they will ask you why you came/what is wrong, give you some paperwork to fill out (try to be as accurate as possible but you do not need to disclose anything you do not want to), and check your vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate, oxygen saturation).
        </li>
        <li>
            You will be asked to wait in the waiting room until someone calls you back, which can take anywhere up to 4+ hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>By law, hospitals are required to provide interpretation services.</b> You can and should ask that members of the team use an interpreter to speak with you if English is not a language you feel comfortable using in this context.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>If you would like to speak to someone with access to additional resources, please call <a href="tel:+1-619-800-2083">+1 (619) 800-2083</a>.</b>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>After the Hospital</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Sometimes the emergency room team will recommend that you pick up prescriptions, medications, or other supplies - if you would like assistance to get those, please call or text <a href="tel:+1-619-800-2083">+1 (619) 800-2083</a>
        </li>
        <li><strong>You have not been processed by CBP but you can still apply for asylum.</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>You must submit that application within 1 year or 365 days of &ldquo;entering&rdquo; the &ldquo;U.S.&rdquo;</li>
                <li>You can use the following legal service networks to search for an attorney who may be able to help you:<ul>

                        <li>

                  </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>You are free to travel to your final destination at this time.</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>If you are staying locally, the hospital should be able to provide you with transportation. If they are unable to, please call or text <a href="tel:+1-619-800-2083">+1 (619) 800-2083</a>, and a volunteer will help to arrange for your transportation.</li>
                <li>If you have a passport (not a copy of your passport) and the means to pay for your ticket, you can travel freely by plane. Please have the hospital arrange for you to get a ride to the airport. If they are unable to, please call or text <a href="tel:+1-619-800-2083">+1 (619) 800-2083</a>, and a volunteer will help to arrange for your transportation.</li>
                <li>If you do not have a passport or need time to plan where you are going, please call or text <a href="tel:+1-619-800-2083">+1 (619) 800-2083</a>, and a volunteer will help. Often times there are resources for shelter and food for a few days while details are arranged.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If you need follow-up medical care, the hospital should be able to provide you with resources based on where you are going and what the medical need is. If they are not able to provide you with resources, please call or text <a href="tel:+1-619-800-2083">+1 (619) 800-2083</a>, and a volunteer will try to help.</li>
